This is an attempt at implementing 3b1b's wordle statistical model optimizing the entropy of it's observations, where entropy is the bits of information gained. 

For the most part, this attempt will be alone, without much referring to 3b1b's source code, other than for data or certain quality of life code blocks. 

The end goal is to not only implement 3b1b's optimal solution to wordle in a feasible runtime, but to eventually build some improvements to the algorithm.

As an initial start, I'm beginning with jupyter notebooks as a POC, however will likely shift away as needed, either to python scripts or C scripts.
